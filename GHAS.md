Secrets like API keys, access tokens, or database credentials are often used for authentication, so leaving them exposed can result in serious security vulnerabilities, such as unauthorized access or data breaches
- Delete the commit history containing the exposed secret
> Secrets, once exposed, remain accessible through the repository's history, even if the secret is no longer in the active codebase. Deleting or rewriting the commit history ensures that the secret is permanently removed from all previous versions of the code. This prevents unauthorized users from retrieving the secret from older commits
- Contact the service provider of the exposed secret to inquire about additional steps
> Service providers (such as cloud services or API providers) may offer specific guidance on how to manage the exposed secret. They might also recommend additional security protocols or flag suspicious activity. Additionally, some services allow you to revoke access to compromised keys or tokens, and the provider can help facilitate this process

- The indirect dependencies, also known as transitive dependencies or subdependencies
> Indirect or transitive dependencies are also tracked by the Dependency graph. These are dependencies not directly included by your project but are necessary for the direct dependencies to function properly. Identifying these helps in understanding the full dependency tree and potential security vulnerabilities within it
- The vendored dependencies checked into a specific directory in your repository but not referenced in your manifest file
> Vendored dependencies, which are included directly in the repository but aren't listed in the manifest file, are recognized by the Dependency graph for some package managers. This includes libraries or packages that are copied into the project to ensure stability or for other reasons

Which sequence correctly represents the steps of the CodeQL analysis workflow?
<details><summary>Show the answer</summary><p>

- Creating a CodeQL database -> Running CodeQL queries -> Interpreting the results
> The correct sequence of steps in the CodeQL analysis workflow begins with "Creating a CodeQL database," which involves extracting data from the codebase and organizing it into a structured format that CodeQL can analyze. The next step is "Running CodeQL queries" against this database to identify potential vulnerabilities or coding issues. Finally, "Interpreting the results" involves reviewing the findings from the queries to understand the potential impact and determine necessary remediation actions

In the context of CodeQL code analysis, what does the term "extraction" refer to?
<details><summary>Show the answer</summary><p>

- Extraction is the process of creating a relational representation of each source file in the codebase
> Extraction, in the context of CodeQL code analysis, refers to the process of creating a relational representation of each source file in the codebase. This step involves analyzing the source code and transforming it into a format (a CodeQL database) that can be efficiently queried by CodeQL. This database then serves as the foundation for running CodeQL queries to identify potential vulnerabilities and coding issues
