Q: In GitHub Actions, how can you ensure that a specific job in a workflow only runs if changes were made to files in either of two different directories?
<details><summary>Show the answer</summary><p>

- **Create a preliminary job to check for changes in the specified directories and use its output in the if condition of the dependent jobs**
> Ensure that a specific job in a GitHub Actions workflow only runs if changes were made to files in either of two different directories involves a two-step process. Initially, you must create a preliminary job that's responsible for detecting changes in the specified directories. This job utilizes git commands to ascertain whether there have been any changes in those directories compared to the previous commit. The outcome of this detection—whether changes were detected or not—is then set as an output of this job
- **Following this, the subsequent jobs within the workflow need to include an if condition that references the output from the preliminary detection job.**
> These jobs are configured to run only if the preliminary job's output indicates that there were changes in the relevant directories. This strategy harnesses GitHub Actions' functionality to share data between jobs using outputs and conditions, providing a nuanced and effective way to control the execution of jobs based on specific changes in the repository. This approach is not only resource-efficient, avoiding unnecessary runs, but also adds clarity and precision to the workflow's execution logic, ensuring that jobs run only when they are truly needed based on the changes made
